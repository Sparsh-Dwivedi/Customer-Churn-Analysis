# Analysis of Customer Churn in a Telecommunications Company

## **Project Title:**
Analysis of Customer Churn in a Telecommunications Company

## **Objective**
<b><i>" To identify key factors that contribute to customer churn and develop strategies to improve customer retention."</i></b>

## **Data**
<b><i> The project utilizes a dataset containing information about customer demographics, service usage, and churn status for a telecommunications company.</i></b>

## **Methodology:**

<br><b>1. Data Exploration and Cleaning: :</b></br>
*	Load and explore the dataset, identifying relevant variables and potential data quality issues.
*	Clean the data by handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.

<br><b>2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): :</b></br>
*	Conduct univariate and bivariate analysis to understand the distribution of key variables and their relationships with churn.
*	Visualizations: 
*	Histograms: Analyze the distribution of values in various columns like monthly charges, total charges, and other numerical variables.
*	Bar charts: Explore the relationship between churn and categorical variables like paperless billing, internet service, and contract type.

<br><b>3.  Insights and Recommendations: :</b></br>
*	Analyze the results of the EDA and modeling to identify key drivers of churn.
*	Develop actionable recommendations for improving customer retention, such as: 
*	Targeted retention campaigns for high-value customers.
*	optimizations and promotions to incentivize customer loyalty.
*	Service enhancements to improve customer satisfaction.
*	Proactive outreach to customers at risk of churn.

## **Project Deliverables:**
•	Data analysis report with findings and visualizations.
•	Presentation summarizing the key findings and recommendations.

## **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):**

<br><b>A. Churn Rate: :</b></br>
* Percentage of customers who stop using a company's product or service within a specific timeframe.
* Formula: (Number of customers lost / Total number of customers at the start of the period) * 100
*  Target: Aim to minimize churn rate over time.

<br><b>B. Customer Retention Rate (CRR): :</b></br>
* The percentage of customers who remain with a company over a specific period.
*	Formula: (Number of customers retained / Total number of customers at the start of the period) * 100
*	Target: Maximize CRR to reduce churn and improve profitability.

<br><b>A. Specific to Paperless Billing: :</b></br>
*	Churn Rate for Paperless Billing Customers: Churn rate specifically for customers using paperless billing.
*	Rate for Non-Paperless Billing Customers: Churn rate for customers who still prefer paper bills.

## **Future Improvements :**

<br><b>A. Churn Prediction Modeling: (Improvements- building ML Predictive Model )</br></b>

*	Develop and evaluate predictive models (e.g., logistic regression, decision tree, random forest) to predict customer churn based on the identified factors.

* Assess model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

<br><b>B. Project deliverables</br></b>

*	Predictive churn models and their evaluation results

*	Determine the distribution of orders by hour of the day.
